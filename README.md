# Slide-Puzzle-with-A-Solver

A simple project to implement A* algorithm.

 _[Slide 8-Puzzle](https://rushour0.github.io/Slide-Puzzle-with-A-Solver/)_

### This slide puzzle solver utilizes A* as its path finding algorithm and treats each move as a state/node and using Manhattan heuristic and Multiple pieces' wise manhattan heuristic, the A* algorithm finds the shortest route back to it's unscrambled state

## How to play with/test this puzzle solver?

- Simply **scramble** the 8-puzzle.
- **Click on a piece** which is near to the open space and it will move to the empty space.
- Press **R** to start unscrambling


### Example solve
