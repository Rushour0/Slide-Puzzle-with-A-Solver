# Slide-Puzzle-with-A-Solver

A simple project to implement A* algorithm.

**This slide puzzle solver utilizes A* as its path finding algorithm and treats each move as a state/node and using Manhattan heuristic and Multiple pieces' wise manhattan heuristic, the A* algorithm finds the shortest route back to it's unscrambled state.**
